# Energy-effciency-ofptimization
energy efficiency optimization description
Energy Optimizer
This Python script provides an energy distribution optimizer using linear programming. It determines the most cost-effective way to distribute energy from multiple sources to various consumers, considering supply limits, demand requirements, and transmission costs.

Features
Define custom energy sources and consumers
Input supply capacities and demand needs
Use cost matrices for source-to-consumer energy transmission
Employ linear programming (via PuLP) to optimize total cost
Clear tabular output of distribution and costs
Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
PuLP Install dependencies using pip:
pip install pulp

Usage

Run the script:

python energy_optimizer.py

The script will:

Print the optimized energy distribution plan

Display the total cost

Show energy sent from each source to each consumer


Example Output

Optimal Energy Distribution Plan:
From Source_A to Consumer_1: 100.0 units
From Source_B to Consumer_2: 200.0 units
...
Total Cost: 1234.56

Customization

To use your own data:

Modify the sources, consumers, supply, demand, and costs dictionaries at the top of the script.
